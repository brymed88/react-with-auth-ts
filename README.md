## Summary

---

The need for this template has arisen from numerous React/NodeJS projects. Rather than re-invent the wheel during each new project, this repo aims to provide a basic React boilerplate site in typescript.

This will be a mono-repo and contain files for both the client and server (NodeJS). It will utilize common packages, api endpoints and components.

Please feel free to leave comments, fork, create an issue or pull request.
